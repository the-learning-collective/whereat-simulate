# Where@ Simulate

Where@ is designed for hundreds of people to use at the same time! But we don't have hundreds of users yet!

This is a grab bag of node scripts to spoof the location of emulators, ping mock location updates to the Where@ server, etc... all in service of producing some nifty demo videos of things like:

* 50 users marching from Zuccotti Park to Union Square
* An affinity group converging on NYSE from disparate locations in the FiDi
* Etc..
